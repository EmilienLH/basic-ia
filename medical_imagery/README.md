# Deep Learning for Medical Imagery Analysis
This folder contains the work completed during the Deep Learning for Medical Imagery Analysis course @ UPC Barcelona (Erasmus semester).

## Projects

- **Skin Lesion Segmentation**: Build and optimize deep learning models for automatic skin lesion boundary detection in dermoscopy images. Starting from a baseline U-Net architecture, various techniques are explored to improve segmentation performance.

- **Multiple Sclerosis Segmentation**: Develop 3D segmentation models for detecting MS lesions in brain MRI scans. Implementation follows a progression from simple baseline models to advanced architectures with performance optimization techniques.

Both projects follow a systematic approach: establish a naive baseline model, then iteratively apply different techniques (data augmentation, architecture modifications, loss functions, etc.) to achieve performance improvements over the baseline results.
