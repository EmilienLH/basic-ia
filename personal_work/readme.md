# Personal Work folder

This folder contains some work I did on my personal time, for fun, practice or experiment. I will upload more files / folder as I go.

## Files 

- mnist_train_test : A notebook that contains a training on the MNIST dataset and a test setup that allows the user to draw the number himself to test the network. This is the first ever CNN model I implemented.
